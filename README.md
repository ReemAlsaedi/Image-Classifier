# Image-Classifier
## Dataset Overview:

The dataset for this project comprises images of 102 different flower species, designed to train an image classifier to recognize and differentiate between these species. This dataset includes numerous labeled images of various flowers, which I will use to develop a deep learning model. The goal is to create an application capable of identifying flower species from images, similar to an app that recognizes and names flowers captured by a smartphone camera.

## Problem Statement:

My primary objective is to develop a Python-based image classification application that can effectively recognize different species of flowers. This involves several steps: loading and preprocessing the image dataset, training a deep learning model on the dataset, and using the trained classifier to predict the content of new images. The application will ultimately be able to identify and classify flower species, but the skills and techniques I learn can be applied to other image classification tasks, such as recognizing car makes and models from pictures.

## Results:

Upon completion of this project, I will have a fully functional image classifier trained to recognize flower species. The application will be implemented in Python and will involve preprocessing the image data, training the model, and making predictions on new images. This classifier can be adapted for various applications beyond flowers, depending on the dataset used and the specific use case. I will ensure to use GPU mode for optimal performance if running this notebook in a workspace.
